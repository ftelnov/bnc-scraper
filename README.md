Intro
---

This project should work in the following way:
1) Scrap the initial data from the binance system for specified instrument;
2) Subscribe on the real-time updates of the instrument using websockets;
3) Display the changes on the UI.

It's just a sample Rust project - I'll work with threads, UI, WS - that's pretty interesting :)
